# Graph Calculator CodeLine Interface

## Description

The Graph Calculator CodeLine Interface is a Java-based application developed as an assignment to learn fundamental data structures and algorithms. This project focuses on graph theory concepts and their practical implementation through a command-line interface (CLI). The application can open and analyze graphs stored in a specific file format, checking properties such as reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, and anti-symmetry. Additionally, it can determine equivalence relations and perform graph searches using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms, both iteratively and recursively.

This project serves as an educational tool to reinforce understanding of basic data structures like stacks and queues, as well as algorithms essential for graph traversal and analysis. By implementing these functionalities, developers gain hands-on experience in handling graph data, applying algorithms efficiently, and interpreting graph properties programmatically.
